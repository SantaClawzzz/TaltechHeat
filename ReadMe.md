# Introduction

This is a DIY reflow solder plate controller design, where the actual plate connects with XT30 connector.<br>
Based on this [project](https://github.com/DerSpatz/PCB-reflow-solder-heat-plate)

It uses USB-C Power Delivery to power it at 20V 5A max.<br>
STM32F103C6 first needs to be flashed through USB DFU and then can be programmed with USB OTG
